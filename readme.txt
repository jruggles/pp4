This program will take a matrix containing 10,000 

To run this program, compile and run it from the command line along with
a matrix file containing a group of points in 3D space, a file for output,
and a constant which will be the number of points to be evaluated.
For example, from the command line in OS X it would look like this:

"$ python pp4.py inputFile.txt outputFile.txt k"
